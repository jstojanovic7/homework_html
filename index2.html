   <h3>A little more about personal life and interests</h3>
         
         <p>
            My nuclear family consists of my mother, father and older brother. My father is an economist and owns a private company. Mother always took care of all of us and made our lives easier. My brother moved to Vienna with his wife - he's been living there for around 9 years now. He works for an insurance company and pretty much has his life planned out. We are a really tight-knit family. Alongside my girlfriend, this is my biggest support system.
         <br/><br/>
            Two years ago, I started living with my girlfriend, Lola. We all know she will soon become my wife. She is a fashion photographer and an art director for a popular lifestyle online magazine here in Serbia. We are happy to say we are fully enjoying our lives.
         <br/><br/>
            I have some other interests and hobbies I'd like to mention :
            <ul class="bolded">
               <li>travelling</li>
               <li>staying up-to-date with emerging technologies</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>watching videos from credible youtube content creators</li>
                  <li>reading blogs and news from credible sources</li>
               </ul>   
               <li>playing recreational basketball</li>
               <li>reading sci-fi books</li>
               <li>watching long tv-shows with Lola after a long work day</li>
               <li>reading about philosophy and psychology</li>
            </ul>
            Aside from acquiring a Masters degree, I am also planning on learning one more language  in the next 5 years. I have my pick on Spanish. Hopefully, it would lead to a life in a Spanish village, with a house pointing right at the sea.
